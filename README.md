# invaderGenerator
See the timeline above (ok maybe not above)? I want to generate commits to obtain the drawing I want (say a space invader).

* How many shades are there?
* How many dates are there?
* What is the timezone of the day? ‚Üê Contributions are timestamped according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than your local time zone. 
* Does the timeline count the number of commits or the number of pushes?
* Which language should I use? Should I give go/rust a try?

[Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)

At first, I want to draw a space invader but asymptoticaly I want to draw any ASCII art (does [libcaca](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca) provide a discretized output) or even Game of Life: instead of a static drawing that will be completed on a given date and then slowly disappear, the drawing will evolve with time to still represent something.
